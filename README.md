Formality.fm
============

Formality is now implemented in itself!

Usage
-----

Right now, Formality generates JavaScript executables, but it will soon generate
Haskell, Scheme and others, allowing you to install it in different ways.

For now, to install, type `npm i -g formality-js`.

To use, type `fmfm example.fmfm`.

Examples and documentation coming soon!
